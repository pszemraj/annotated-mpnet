        Init function for the layer. I will try to summarize all the args here.

        Args:
            embedding_dim: the embedding dimension for the layer. Should always be 768 really
            ffn_embedding_dim: this is the size of the hidden layer in the fully-connected
                subsection of the layer right AFTER self-attention. Also known as the feed-forward
                network component of the encoder layer
            num_attention_heads: the number of attention heads for each layer. Default here is 8,
                but you will usually want to bump this higher if your model is accepting longer
                sequence lengths
            dropout: pretty straightforward, but this is the dropout prob for the FC layers in the
                forward pass
            attention_dropout: similar to above, but is the dropout prob within the self-attention
                mechanism
            activation_fn: the activation function you will be using in this network.
            add_bias_kv: boolean that dictates whether or not to add a bias parameter to the K, V
                matrices in the self-attention mechanism
            add_zero_attn: boolean that dictate whether or not to add zero attention to the
                self-attention mechanism
            normalize_before: boolean that determines if the LayerNorm will be applied BEFORE or
                AFTER the self-attention calculation. Functionally they are very similar, but the
                standard is to normalize before
            export: boolean that would enable ONNX tracing for exporting, but I think we won't be
                using this
